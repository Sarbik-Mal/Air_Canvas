# Air Canvas 🎨✋

Air Canvas is a real-time hand-tracking-based drawing application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures. Built using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and NumPy, this project leverages computer vision to detect hand movements and translate them into virtual strokes on a canvas.

## 🚀 Features
- **Hand Gesture Drawing:** Draw on the screen by moving your index finger.
- **Color Selection:** Change brush color dynamically.
- **Clear Canvas:** Wipe the entire screen with hand movement.
- **Save Canvas:** Save the drawing by with hand movement.
- **Virtual Pointer:** Displays a pointer where the hand is detected.
- **Smooth & Efficient Tracking:** Uses Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sarbik-Mal/Air_Canvas.git
